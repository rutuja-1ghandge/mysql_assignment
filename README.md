📘 MySQL Assignment – Complete Solved SQL Queries

This repository contains the complete, topic-wise solved MySQL assignment based on the Classic Models Database. It showcases a wide range of SQL concepts starting from basic queries to advanced database operations. All questions are solved with clean, correct, and easy-to-understand SQL code.

The assignment begins with fundamental SQL operations such as SELECT, WHERE, DISTINCT, AND, LIKE, used for filtering data and working with text patterns. It then moves into CASE statements for customer segmentation, followed by GROUP BY, aggregation functions, HAVING clause, and date functions, which are used to analyze product sales and monthly payment activities.

A major section covers Database Constraints, where tables like Customers and Orders are created using PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, and NOT NULL constraints. The project also includes JOINS to identify top shipping countries, and SELF JOINS to map employees to their managers.

Further, the assignment includes DDL commands such as creating and modifying tables, and continues with SQL Views like product_category_sales to summarize category-wise revenue and order counts.

Advanced concepts such as Stored Procedures with parameters, Error Handling, and Triggers are also implemented. The stored procedure returns country-wise yearly payment totals in “K” format, while the trigger automatically corrects negative working hours before inserting data.

The project also covers Window Functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, LAG, LEAD) to analyze customer order frequency and calculate Year-over-Year growth. Subqueries are used to compare product prices against average values.

This repository serves as a full reference for SQL beginners, students, and data analytics learners who want practical, industry-level SQL examples.
